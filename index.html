          <h1>The Library Field</h1> 
          <p>Library Field is a proposal to dedicate 5-20 acres of land to create an experimental new vision for what a sustainable institution could be if it is of, by, and for the land it inhabits. Libraries serve as an interdisciplinary crossroads for governments, schools, businesses, communities, or any other group that wishes to pool and share knowledge. The Library “Field” takes that interdisciplinary nature literally, and invites participants to engage in the production of the library.</p>

                  <h3>
                    What are you talking about?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    By choosing an open, seemingly undeveloped space to develop a new library, participants are asked to take part in, practice, and connect every other discipline or field in order to create what the library itself will be. No space is actually empty! Any field is full of fungi, plants, and animals; it has a history of use by human beings, its geological and botanical occupants serve as natural repositories of place-based data, documenting, in sediments and tissues, their perseverance across centuries and millennia, and even the air moving through space requires an inventory of the electronic transmissions and the acknowledgement of the prevailing winds. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This inventory prompts a rigorous examination of presence, of process, of observation and connection. Libraries are often about nouns: collections of people, places and things. Being present, being aware, being in good relation with the land - can give rise to another kind of institution. This process might inform the creation of traditional library protocols like a facility, an acquisitions policy, or a community lending agreement. It might also inform something entirely new.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The first phase of the project would be process-intensive research. There is no Library Field at the moment, no actual location. Additionally, there is also no community to engage. A location for a library field might be an open plot of woods with a stream running through it, but it also might feature an abandoned strip mall with outmoded infrastructure running underneath it. How would the presence of different features, phenomena, histories, and ecologies influence the participants and community that might be drawn into a process that generates the Library Field? In the first phase, we would develop a systematic approach to the problem of defining 'the field' and design a methodology to determine what composes it. We will examine what disciplinary and creative fields converge on the geographic field. Outputs would include writing, visual art, presentations and exhibitions, websites and software. All of these outputs either describe or are representations of the process required to make a Library Field.

                  <p>
                    The second stage is also research focused, and might use a real piece of land as a test site. The work at the test site would be informed by, conceived of, and built upon the research outputs from phase one. This would prompt a comprehensive review of every mineral, organism, ecological and climatic attribute, including cultural and particularly indigenous histories of the land. In order to “grow” an institution that could be sustainably generated by a piece of land, the land's features and facets, as well as its connection to adjacent lands and systems should be assessed, cataloged, and preserved but this project examines the means by which any of this could be accomplished. This second stage of research could be thought of as a dress rehearsal, preparation for an actual long-term Library Field.

                    Who are we?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    The <a href="https://metro.org" target="blank">Metropolitan New York Library Council</a> (METRO) is a network of libraries, archives, and museums in New York City and Westchester County and a non-profit service provider for knowledge organizations all over the world. We work to advance excellence in the library, archive and museum professions, and we do this through research, software development, logistics, programs and events, exhibits, and other innovative approaches. The proposal outlined here, the “Library Field,” is a new approach for METRO; we are considering artistic research as a means of inquiry by which we might design new services and advance our field.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Ultimately, all of this research and testing is driving toward a larger goal. That goal is to identify an entity who might donate or endow a piece of land to METRO so that this can become an ongoing project. We would aim to do this somewhere within our immediate service region, likley in Westchester County NY. At the same time that the artistic research is underway, we would begin the administrative research regarding the impact this would have on the organization, including strategic assessment of what type of capacities METRO might need to grow to steward a project like this over 5, 10, and 20 years.

                  <p>
                  All ideas stand on the shoulders of many others. Nowhere is proper citation, reference, and acknowdlegement more important than in a library! Below is a incomplete list of articles, books, artworks, and organizations of all kinds that inspire us. Any omissions are accidental.
